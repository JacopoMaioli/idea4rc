### Scope

> Specify **HL7 FHIR logical models** and **profiles** to be used within
> the European project **IDEA4RC**. This project studies the
> implementation of an intelligent ecosystem to improve the
> governance, the sharing, and the re-use of health data for rare cancers.

### The IDEA4RC project

#### Overview 

**<span class="underline">PanCareSurPass</span>** is a EU funded
Research and Innovation action aiming to study the scale-up and
implementation of the digital Survivorship Passport to improve
people-centred care for childhood cancer survivors.

Building on the principles of the European Data strategy, the Rare Cancer
Data Ecosystem concept proposed by IDEA4RC will unite available data sources
and equip them with strong data governance controls to lay down the basis
for an embryonic data spece for rare cancers. This because despite their
relevance, rare cancers in general get a few scientific consideration and
financial support. Carrying out clinical studies is difficult, because of
the small number of sample populations. Therefore, clinical evidence is
more difficult to build, clinical management is more complex, and shortage
of accesible cancer registries and data is a fundamental obstacle. These can
be overcome only through large collaborations exploiting networks
specializing in rare cancers, that pool knowledge and data together.

#### Objectives

The overall aim of PanCareSurPass is to **leverage the digital
transformation of healthcare to improve people-centred survivorship care
by scaling up and implementing an interoperable SurPass v2.0 across
Europe.**

##### Preparation for Implementation

1.  **design and conduct a multi-country pre-implementation study** to
    assess the barriers and facilitators for scaling up use of the
    SurPass v2.0

2.  **develop a practical Implementation Strategy** informed by the
    findings of the pre-implementation activities and **IT technical
    specifications** for SurPass v2.0 ensuring interoperability and
    cybersecurity.

3.  **develop, test and launch SurPass v2.0** using the IT
    specifications developed use in the multi-country implementation
    study.

##### Implementation and evaluation

4.  **conduct a multi-country implementation study of SurPass v2.0** for
    people-centred care with >5-year CCS and to **assess
    implementation** in terms of people-centred care (e.g. activation,
    empowerment, satisfaction, increase in knowledge), feasibility and
    cost effectiveness.

5.  **conduct a parallel observational qualitative study using SurPass
    v2.0** for delivering people-centred survivorship care to <5-year
    CCS and >5-year CCS (but with limited treatment data available).

##### European Future Implementation & Achieving Impact

6.  **develop a Prediction Model** using data from the
    pre-implementation activities and multi-country implementation study
    to enable healthcare decision-makers to assess the suitability and
    costs of SurPass v2.0.

7.  **host an Implementation Toolkit** for further European
    implementation of the SurPass for people-centred care in various
    healthcare settings across Europe.

8.  **disseminate and communicate the importance of people-centred
    survivorship care and results of PanCareSurPass** to key
    stakeholders to promote future implementation of SurPass v2.0 to
    improve people-centred survivorship care in Europe.
