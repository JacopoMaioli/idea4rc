IDEA4RC aims at developing an IT infrastructure to facilitate the sharing and re-use of health data among clinical centers to promote research on rare cancers and improve patientsâ€™ access to high quality care. Our challenge is building a new tool to overcome interoperability issues and make it easier to comply with privacy regulations.

To achive this result a common data model has been agreed.</p>
<p>

An overview of this model is provided hereafter; a detailed ERD is instead shown in the <a href="model-erd.html">IDEA4RC Detailed ERD Model page.</a>
</p>
<p>The IDEA4RC model has been then formalized as HL7 FHIR Logical Models, listed in the <a href="logicalModel.html">IDEA4RC Logical Models page.</a></p>
